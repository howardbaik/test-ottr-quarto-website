# OTTR for Websites -- Quarto version!

Get started by going to [ottrproject.org](https://www.ottrproject.org/getting_started.html)!

This is a template for creating websites from  qmd files hosted on GitHub with three helpful automations following a pull request to the repository: spelling check, broken link check, and website rendering.

- Check for spelling errors more intensively than RStudio and allow you to add words to the dictionary
- Check for broken links - you will be warned about broken links
- Automatic rendering of the website for previewing before merges
- Automatic rendering of the website upon merging to main
- Docker images that can be customized.
